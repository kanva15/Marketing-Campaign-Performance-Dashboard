# 📊 Marketing Campaign Performance Dashboard

This project analyzes a marketing campaign dataset using **MySQL for schema setup & data storage**, **Python for preprocessing**, and **Power BI for interactive business analytics**. It uncovers insights on conversion rates, spend lift across customer segments, and total revenue generated by marketing campaigns — all critical for data-driven ROI optimization.

---

## 📥 Data Source
- Original dataset: [Kaggle - Marketing Campaign](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodsaldanha/arketing-campaign)
- Cleaned version: `cleaned_marketing_campaign.csv` included in this repository for demonstration & analysis.

---

## 🚀 Tools & Stack
- **Data:** Marketing campaign dataset (Kaggle)
- **Backend:** MySQL (schema setup & data storage)
- **Scripting:** Python (Pandas for initial preprocessing & CSV prep)
- **Analytics:** Power BI (DAX measures, interactive visuals, slicers)

---

## 🐍 Python Preprocessing
Performed initial CSV inspection and verified delimiters using Python & Pandas, then exported a clean file `cleaned_marketing_campaign.csv` for loading into MySQL.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the original CSV with correct separator
df = pd.read_csv("marketing_campaign.csv", sep=';')

# Quick inspection
print(df.head())

# Saved cleaned file
df.to_csv("cleaned_marketing_campaign.csv", index=False)
```

## 📈 Key Business Questions Answered
- ✅ What % of customers responded to marketing campaigns (conversion rate)?
- ✅ How much more do campaign responders spend vs overall customers (spend lift)?
- ✅ Which segments (by marital status & education) drive higher ROI?
- ✅ How does total spend trend over customer join dates?

---

## 💡 Custom DAX Measures
This dashboard leverages advanced DAX in Power BI to quantify marketing effectiveness:

```DAX

Conversion Rate = 
DIVIDE(SUM(customers[Response]), COUNT(customers[ID]), 0)

Average Spend per Respondent = 
CALCULATE(AVERAGE(customers[Total_Spend]), customers[Response] = 1)

Total Revenue from Responders = 
CALCULATE(SUM(customers[Total_Spend]), customers[Response] = 1)

Spend Lift % = 
DIVIDE(
    [Average Spend per Respondent] - AVERAGE(customers[Total_Spend]),
    AVERAGE(customers[Total_Spend]), 0)
)
```
