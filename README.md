# 📊 Marketing Campaign Performance Dashboard

This project analyzes a marketing campaign dataset using **MySQL for ETL**, **Python for preprocessing**, and **Power BI for interactive business analytics**. It uncovers insights on conversion rates, spend lift across customer segments, and total revenue generated by marketing campaigns — all critical for data-driven ROI optimization.

---

## 🚀 Tools & Stack
- **Data:** Marketing campaign dataset (Kaggle)
- **Backend:** MySQL (ETL, schema setup, data cleaning, loading)
- **Scripting:** Python (Pandas for initial preprocessing & CSV prep)
- **Analytics:** Power BI (DAX measures, interactive visuals, slicers)

---

## 📈 Key Business Questions Answered
- ✅ What % of customers responded to marketing campaigns (conversion rate)?
- ✅ How much more do campaign responders spend vs overall customers (spend lift)?
- ✅ Which segments (by marital status & education) drive higher ROI?
- ✅ How does total spend trend over customer join dates?

---

## 💡 Custom DAX Measures
This dashboard leverages advanced DAX in Power BI to quantify marketing effectiveness:

```DAX
Conversion Rate = 
DIVIDE(SUM(customers[Response]), COUNT(customers[ID]), 0)

Average Spend per Respondent = 
CALCULATE(AVERAGE(customers[Total_Spend]), customers[Response] = 1)

Total Revenue from Responders = 
CALCULATE(SUM(customers[Total_Spend]), customers[Response] = 1)

Spend Lift % = 
DIVIDE(
    [Average Spend per Respondent] - AVERAGE(customers[Total_Spend]),
    AVERAGE(customers[Total_Spend]), 0)
)

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
